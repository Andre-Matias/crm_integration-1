Hydra Queries
================

Repo with SQL queries for Hydra & Yamato databases in Amazon Redshift.  

<br />

Recommendations
-----

- add a file for each query;
- use descriptive names (e.g.: `sessions_by_sources` , use underscores instead of spaces);
- file extension can be `.sql` or `.md` if you prefer to use markdown format;
- comment inside the file: at the top briefly describe the output of the query and within the query please explain any important step (like any categorizations in the data, join, etc.).
